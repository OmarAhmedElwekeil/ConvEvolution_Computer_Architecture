# ConvEvolution_Computer_Architecture
This project demonstrates the performance evolution of 3D convolution implementations. Starting from a naive baseline, it introduces optimization techniques using Loop unrolling, SIMD and OpenMP to significantly improve execution speed. Ideal for learning about low-level optimization, parallel programming and many else
